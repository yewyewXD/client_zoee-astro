    "title": "Is astrology a science?",
    "description": "Nowadays, astrology is not recognised as a science in most of the countries of the world (like psychology, economics or sociology for example).  <div class='mt-3' /> However, before the 17th century, astrology was a widely recognised discipline (it was even taught in universities). At this time, astronomy and astrology were under the same branch. <div class='mt-3' /> It’s the separation of this 2 disciplines at the end of the 17th that badly affected the reputation of astrology.  <div class='mt-3' /> But you need to know that nowadays not all the countries are the same about astrology. In India for example, astrology is consider as a science and there is many astrology universities. <div class='mt-3' /> Oh and I forgot to mention that astrology works with the calculations of astronomy (which are scientific)."

    "description": "Clearly not. I will make it simple and clear: everyone can learn astrology, you don’t need to have a special talent of gift and it’s the most logic thing ever. Why? <div class='mt-3' /> Because astrology is simply another calendar. Our calendar look at the Sun. The Lunar calendar uses the Moon. But astrology look at all the planets of the Sun system (and even asteroids!). <div class='mt-3' /> And it works with calculations from astronomy (nothing magical right?). It’s also based on observations of the influences of the celestial bodies on Earth made since few thousands years (by all the civilizations around the world)!"

    "title": "How astrology works?",
    "description": "You know that the Moon influences the tides, how plants grow, the animals and our emotions right? Then why the other planets wouldn’t have any impact on us? <div class='mt-3' /> Everything influence everything in the Universe through energies, rays, gravity and other influences we can’t explain by science.  <div class='mt-3' /> Also, planetary cycles are just a bigger version of our cycles. Everything in the universe exist in the macrocosm and the microsome (in a bigger and smaller version if you prefer). "
